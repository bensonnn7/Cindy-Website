            <p id="ProblemsDetail1" class="Paragraph">To narrow down the topic I have chosen, I read articles and talked to seniors to understand their needs. I found that almost every senior keeps track of his/her blood pressure to some extend, since it is one of the most critical vital of a person’s well being. </p>
            <p id="ProblemsDetail2" class="Paragraph">Being called “the silent killer”, hypertension produces no symptoms at all. People affected are usually suggested to monitor their blood pressure levels frequently to prevent any related health problems. With several products out in the market, people can perform this task effortlessly. However, a significant group of users has been left out. About 53% of people over the age of 50 is affected by hypertension. Nearly two-thirds of Americans own a smartphone in 2015, while ownership levels remain relatively low among seniors. </p>

I intend to help people affected by hypertension to better monitor their health. I will focus on the usability of a certain user group, which is people over the age of 65. The end product of this thesis project will be a user-friendly mobile application, aiming to improve satisfaction of user experience in digital devices for senior users.</p>

            <p id="ResearchDetail1" class="Paragraph">It’s a common belief that seniors don’t like to keep up with technology. From physical limitations, to their mindsets, people often misunderstood them for being stubborn and old-fashioned. From the results of surveys I passed around both physically and online, it’s surprising to me that seniors are very open to the idea of learning new technologies that maybe beneficial to their daily lives. Some features they are very interested in include:</p>
