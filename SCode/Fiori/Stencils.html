    <section class="section3">
        <h4 class="intro">Life Before Abstract</h4>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="thirdAbstractDetail1">As a designer who’s responsible for maintaining a design system’s UI library in Sketch, I’m always looking for ways
            to make my life easier. The complications begin with the need to manage two files: a file that’s shared among our immediate team, and another file
            that’s distributed to product teams within or outside SAP. Keeping track of what color has been updated, which text label has a new padding, and which
            component is partially released has been overwhelming, but updating the files accordingly is another pain. </p>
        <div class="abstractImage2"></div>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="thirdAbstractDetail2">Until one day I heard about Abstract, a version control tool with other features such as collaboration and developer
            hand-off, I downloaded it immediatly and wished that I could have known about it earlier. I ended up taking the lead to reinvent our workflow as a design systems team. </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section4">
        <h4 class="intro">One Source of Truth</h4>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="fourAbstractDetail1">Before using Abstract, our team lacked a single source of truth for our design files. We used shared folders for everything. A folder
            for specifications, a folder for work-in-progress sketch files, a folder for images we use in our guidelines articles, a folder for archived files and many more. This process
            seemed to work for a while until the team started having new and previous members, and our design system grew to having a total of 60+ components with 3 release cycles every year.
            Not to mention the small bugs we fix by updating the specifications… At some point, I realized what we were doing was simply not scalable.  </p>
        <div class="abstractImage3"></div>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="fourAbstractDetail2">Abstract came in at the right time to simplify our complex workflow. Instead of having multiple shared folders that depend on everyone to
            upload files manually, we create and edit our files directly in Abstract. This removes the dependency on relying on everyone to upload their files. As the team grows, we can easily know
            where previous members’ files are located, and new members can have a better onboarding experience.</p>

    <section class="section5">
        <h4 class="intro">Collaborating As a Team</h4>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="fiveAbstractDetail1">Our team’s collaboration has also been a lot smoother since using Abstract. Each of us may create our own branch if we would like to make a change
            to the master files. Abstract keeps track of our changes and makes it visible to everyone, promoting transparency across the team. One difference between the workflow of our team and product
            teams is that we don’t necessarily collaborate on the same file, meanwhile, we depend on each other’s work. Sometimes we have to pull a few components from team members to explore on a new
            component or pattern. By giving everyone access to all master files and working files, we are able to save a lot of time from digging around in layers of shared folders.</p>
        <div class="abstractImage5"></div>
        <h4 class="intro2">A Connected System with Linked Libraries</h4>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="fiveAbstractDetail2">Abstract came in at the right time to simplify our complex workflow. Instead of having multiple shared folders that depend on everyone to
            upload files manually, we create and edit our files directly in Abstract. This removes the dependency on relying on everyone to upload their files. As the team grows, we can easily know
            where previous members’ files are located, and new members can have a better onboarding experience.</p>

    <div class="endSection5">
        <p class="Paragraph" id="fiveAbstractDetail3">Let’s look at our filter pattern as an example. From the highlighted area on the left, you can see that the pattern is basically built by inserting symbols
            from linked libraries. If the filter form cell has an update for instance, the notification label on the top right corner will notify us about library updates. We will be able to pull changes
            directly from the linked file without having to edit multiple files. With linked libraries, we are getting closer to the goal of having everything consistent throughout our design system.</p>
    </div>


    <section class="section6">
        <h4 class="intro">Efficiency & The End of Duplicative Work</h4>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="sixAbstractDetail1">Having our component library is a milestone for our team as now we are ready to generate secondary assets and files from it. Before using Abstract, we manage
            multiple folders for different purposes which leads to duplicative effort and a waste of time. I remember copying a symbol from our stencils/library Sketch file to a new file while working on image assets
            for guidelines. Later on, I realized I have been using the incorrect text color and thus the symbol in all related files need to be updated one at a time. Being able to contribute to one source of truth as a
            team provides us an efficient way to push and pull updates across all our files.</p>
        <div class="abstractImage7"></div>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="sixAbstractDetail2">After setting up our component library as a “project” in Abstract, we created other projects for guidelines images, specifications and stencils. The idea is to link the
            libraries from the component library project to the rest of the projects. Below is a screenshot of our guidelines project where you can see the “Profile Header - Guidelines” file has three linked libraries:
            object and profile header from the component project, and an image template file. </p>
    </section>

        <div class="abstractImage8"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="endSection6">
        <p class="Paragraph" id="sixAbstractDetail3">The same idea applies to our specifications and stencils. Since our specifications involve a lot of written notes and component variations, it is still reasonable for us to
            have a separate project for it instead of relying on the inspect feature in Abstract only. The stencils project contains a file
            which is a compilation of linked symbols from our component library to distribute to product teams to consume. </p>
    </div>

    <hr class="line2">

    <section class="section7">
        <h4 class="intro">Compiling Stencils</h4>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="sevenAbstractDetail1">Producing stencils files have been a breeze after we switched to the new workflow. By simply inserting the symbols from the component library, the stencils files become a collection of our latest designs. There are no more duplicative symbols and text styles to clean up as everything is imported directly from our single source of truth. Our stencils are available to everyone, <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-ios/article/stencils/" id="stencilesLink" target="_blank">you can download them here.</a> </p>

        <!--<p class="Paragraph" id="sevenAbstractDetail2">The compare feature displays two versions side-by-side with the overlay button to highlight significant changes. This transforms our previous workflow of archiving. There’s no more moving old files to archived folders, no more strange naming conventions. It’s as simple as design, save and commit. </p>-->

        <h4 class="header">Final Thoughts</h4>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="thoughts">If you are a designer and are considering to switch to the Abstract workflow, I highly recommend you to
            explore more on it. Although it will require you or your team some time to understand how it works and to set up your files properly, the
            amount of time your team could save is totally worth the effort. </p>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="thoughts1">I felt really accomplished after reinventing our new workflow with Abstract. It was indeed a great
            problem solving exercise and the results made our team’s daily life easier and more pleasurable. </p>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="thoughts2">I would like to give a shout-out to the Abstract team for spending time with us to answer
            our questions while we were evaluating the tool. You helped giving us back time to do actual design and we are thankful for it.  </p>
