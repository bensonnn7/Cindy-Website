        <p class="Paragraph" id="NativeDetail1">Being part of a design systems team, one of the most exciting part of our job is seeing what we designed being implemented in real life. We have been continuously supporting product teams within or outside of SAP during the past three years. Although we only work with each product team for a short period of time, we were able to add value and provide guidance on how to utilize our components. Participating in these workshops has a great impact on our decisions for the design system. This is an opportunity for us to test, validate and evaluate our components and decide if further enhancements are needed. </p>

        <h4 class="intro">Three-Day Workshop</h4>

        <p class="Paragraph" id="threeDay1">Workshops are a great starting point for any product to identify problems, prioritize painpoints and create prototypes for validation rapidly. Our team’s role is to provide guidance on how to best utilize the Fiori for iOS components and patterns. In a few cases, we would be designing the app if the product team does not have designers. </p>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="threeDay2"> Our workshops follow a three-day agenda, with the goal to make decisions while key stakeholders are all in one room. The product teams are required to bring in end users in order to register for a workshop, this would make sure we are designing for the right audience and to allow us to validate our ideas quickly.</p>
        <div class="NativeIOSImage2"></div>
        <p class="Paragraph" id="threeDay3">By using the resources our team provides, such as the stencils, guidelines, and Mentor App, designers and developers are able to collaborate efficiently within and after the workshops. The deliverable of the workshop is a high-fidelity prototype that the product team can take home with, allowing them to continue to develop the product with the most complicated problems already addressed.</p>

        <p class="Paragraph" id="SupportDetail">Sometimes a product team would request additinoal design support from us. We typically set up recurring review sessions to discuss the challenges the product is facing and provide suggestions based on our experience. If a custom component is needed, we work closely with the team to design a component that would meet their specific needs and requirements, as well as ensuring that the component adheres to mobile design best practices and the iOS Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
